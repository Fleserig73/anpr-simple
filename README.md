# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System
This is a Python implementation of an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system. The system is capable of detecting and recognizing number plates from images.

## Features
- (Number plate detection): The system utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect number plates in an image.

- (Number plate recognition): Once a number plate is detected, the system applies optical character recognition (OCR) to recognize the text present on the plate.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Fleserig73/anpr-simple.git

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To use the ANPR system, follow these steps:

1. open `main.py` file and change PATH
2. run `main.py` and the image will display
